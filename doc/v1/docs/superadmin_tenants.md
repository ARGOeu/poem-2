# Tenants

Tenant page is accessible from the menu on the left side. It is shown in the image below. 

![SuperAdmin Tenants](figures/superadmin_tenants.png)

The figure shows main info on each tenant: Postgres DB schema name, POEM url, and total number of probes and metrics used by the given tenant. There is also so called **SuperPOEM tenant** which is not a technically a tenant. Information given on the SuperPOEM tenant probes and metrics refers to the total number of probes and metric templates given in POEM.
