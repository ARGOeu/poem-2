# Tenant POEM guide

## Adding groups of resources
Only **tenant POEM admins** have necessary permissions to add groups of resources. 

**Step 1:** Go to [administration page](tenant_administration.md).

**Step 2:** In *Authentication and authorization* section pick the group of resources you wish to add. Available are:

* groups of aggregations,
* groups of metrics,
* groups of metric profiles,
* groups of thresholds profiles.

**Step 3:** Click the **Add** button.

**Step 4:** Name the group and optionally add resources to it. Details are described in [groups of resources documentation](tenant_groups_of_resources.md#sections).

## Importing metrics

Tenant POEM users cannot add metrics by themselves, they can only import one of the metric templates. If they want to add a metric that does not exist among metric templates, they should inform SuperAdmin POEM admins, so that they can add it to metric templates.

Importing metrics is described in detail in [metric templates documentation](tenant_metric_templates.md).
