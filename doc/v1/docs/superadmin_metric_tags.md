The list of metrics is shown in the `Metric templates` section. In this section, the associated metric templates may be searched using the `Search` field on top of the section. Furthermore, for adding or removing metric templates from the list, one may use `+` and `x` buttons at the end of every row of table (`+` button is used for adding, `x` button is used for removing). When adding a new metric template, one gets a select field from which one may choose from existing metric templates (shown in figure below).
