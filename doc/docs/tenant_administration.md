![Tenant Administration](figures/tenant_administration.png)

First section are links to component pages users are allowed to modify. They are all also accessible from the menu of the left side.

Second section, **Authentication and authorization**, is only available through Administration page, and therefore, only superusers can modify them.

Third section, **SuperAdmin POEM data**, are pages of read-only resources. They are set up through SuperAdmin POEM UI, and tenant users are not allowed to modify them.

In fourth section, **APIKey Permissions**, users are able to see API keys for tenant.
